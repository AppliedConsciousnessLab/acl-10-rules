Rule 6 – Authenticity Reduces Friction

Pretending is expensive.

When behavior, values, and inner signals are misaligned, the system spends
constant energy maintaining the gap. This creates friction, fatigue, and
confusion that people often misinterpret as laziness or lack of motivation.

Authenticity is not self-expression.
It is efficiency.

When you act in alignment with what is true for you:
- Decisions require less force
- Stress decreases
- Energy stabilizes
- Trust in self increases

When you act out of alignment:
- Small tasks feel heavy
- Motivation fluctuates
- Resentment accumulates
- Burnout accelerates

Authenticity does not mean saying everything you think.
It means not constantly overriding your own signals.

This rule follows naturally:
Care stabilizes the system.
Safety enables learning.
Capacity sustains effort.
Clarity reveals truth.
Authenticity removes internal drag.

You move faster when nothing inside you is fighting the direction of travel.

Reduce friction.
Tell the truth you can live with.
Act from alignment.
