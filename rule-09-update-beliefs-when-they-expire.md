Rule 9 – Update Beliefs When They Expire

Beliefs are tools.
Not truths.

A belief is useful only as long as it accurately reflects reality and supports function. When conditions change, beliefs that once protected you can quietly become constraints.

Outdated beliefs do not announce themselves.
They feel familiar.
They feel safe.
They feel true.

When beliefs are not updated:
- Perception narrows
- Options disappear
- Behavior repeats
- Growth stalls

When beliefs are updated:
- Reality becomes clearer
- Choice expands
- Energy returns
- Learning resumes

Updating a belief does not mean you were wrong.
It means you adapted.

This rule requires everything that came before it:
Care reduces threat.
Safety allows questioning.
Capacity sustains uncertainty.
Clarity reveals mismatch.
Authenticity supports honesty.
Progress keeps momentum.
Meaning provides context.

Without safety, beliefs defend themselves.
With safety, beliefs evolve.

Question what once helped you survive.
Keep what still works.
Release what no longer does.
