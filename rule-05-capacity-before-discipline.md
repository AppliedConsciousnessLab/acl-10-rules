Rule 5 – Capacity Before Discipline

Discipline is not a moral trait.
It is a capacity outcome.

When capacity is low, discipline feels like force.
When capacity is sufficient, discipline feels natural.

Capacity includes:
- Physical energy
- Cognitive bandwidth
- Emotional regulation
- Time margin
- Environmental support

When people “fail at discipline,” they are usually exceeding their capacity.
They are asking a depleted system to perform as if it were resourced.

This produces shame, self-criticism, and collapse.
Not growth.

Discipline applied without capacity becomes punishment.
Discipline applied with capacity becomes alignment.

You do not build discipline by demanding more.
You build discipline by increasing capacity first.

Rest increases capacity.
Safety preserves capacity.
Clarity protects capacity.
Care restores capacity.

Only then does discipline stick.

Build the container before enforcing the rule.
