# ACL 101 — 10 Rules to Rewrite Your Reality

This repository is the technical and research companion to the book:

**“ACL 101 — 10 Rules to Rewrite Your Reality”**

It exists to provide transparent, inspectable grounding for the ideas presented in the book, without requiring belief, ideology, or agreement.

This is not a self-help framework.
It is a regulation-first operating model based on how human systems actually function under stress, learning, and change.
