Rule Map — How the 10 Rules Fit Together

Phase 1: Regulation & Safety
(Rules 1–2)

Rule 1 establishes physiological and emotional regulation.
Rule 2 ensures the system is safe enough to learn.

Without this phase, all later effort collapses.

Phase 2: Capacity & Clarity
(Rules 3–5)

Rules 3 and 5 build the resources needed for sustained effort.
Rule 4 ensures perception is clear before interpretation.

This phase prevents burnout, shame cycles, and false meaning.

Phase 3: Alignment & Motion
(Rules 6–7)

Rule 6 removes internal friction through authenticity.
Rule 7 prioritizes movement over perfection.

This phase converts capacity into progress.

Phase 4: Integration & Evolution
(Rules 8–10)

Rule 8 allows meaning to emerge naturally.
Rule 9 keeps beliefs current and functional.
Rule 10 stabilizes gains through gratitude.

This phase allows the system to rest, integrate, and continue evolving.

The rules are sequential but reinforcing.
Later rules strengthen earlier ones.
